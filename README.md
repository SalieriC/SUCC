# SUCC - SWADE Ultimate Condition Changer
<p align="center"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SalieriC/SUCC/refs/heads/main/documentation/assets/succ-header-new.webp" style="width: 900px; height: auto;"> </p>

This module is meant to change the condition icons and effects in the SWADE system (v.1+) on Foundry VTT. SUCC is based on [Combat Utility Belt](https://github.com/death-save/combat-utility-belt) but specifically tailored for the SWADE system which allows maximum support and compatibility for players and game masters on that system without the need to ignore any incompatible features found on CUB. We can also react more quickly to changes made in the system. It provides many of the features found in CUB (such as the condition lab which enables game masters to customise existing conditions and set up their own). SUCC also provides a strong API other developers can use within their modules. As a result it is already a dependency for other popular SWADE modules such as [SWIM](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros) and [Better Rolls for Savage Worlds](https://github.com/javierriveracastro/betteroll-swade) and thus is fully compatible with both.  
If you want to support the development of SUCC, please consider donating on [![Ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/salieric).  

## Mentions & Credits
### Chat messages & code base
The style (CSS) and part of the template (HBS) for the condition to chat messages are used from [Combat Utility Belt](https://github.com/death-save/combat-utility-belt) (CUB) with kind permission from errational. The Condition Lab and underlying code base was also taken from CUB which is in line with its license.
Great thanks go to @ddbrown30 for all his work and his patience. Without him SUCC wouldn't be as user friendly and powerful as it is today. He basically took CUB as a base and rebuilt SUCC on that to bring over as many features from CUB as possible without loosing any of SUCCs own functionality it had at that point.
